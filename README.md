# graphiscaler

Scaling the graphs of Android type.

## Introduction :point_up:

This repo contains the implementation of a [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/) sample app that shows the full typographical range of Android. The sample was made to illustrate typography in Udacity's [Material Design for Android Developers](https://www.udacity.com/course/material-design-for-android-developers--ud862) class. The class can be found online. Original code is stored in [this](https://github.com/udacity/ud862-samples) repository.

## Version History :package:

**latest** 	[XML Test v1.0.0](https://github.com/joshua-kairu/xml-test/releases/download/v1.0/XML-Test-v1.0.0.apk) 	Thursday, May 26, 2016
This repo tries its best to follow the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines.

## How To Use :wrench:

:zero: Fire up ze app.

:one: You'll see all possible Android typographical styles in a scrollable list.

:two: The "Display 4" and the "Headline" "Hello World"s are written using the Courgette Regular True Type Font (TTF). This was done to show how to load custom font into an Android app. 

Here is a video of the app in action.

## Abilities :muscle:

This app can:
* Show almost all the available Android types.
* Showcase the Courgette Regular TTF in Android.

## Limitations :worried:

This app is rather tutorial-ly. :wink: It can't:
* Allow you to change the font of the types displayed.
* Persist the Courgette Regular after a screen rotation.

## Possible Future Work :fast_forward:

As of Thursday, June 2, 2016, some of the things that can be done in the future with this app are: 
- [ ] Allow font change.
- [ ] Use other kinds of fonts.

Some of these items have been implemented in a related repo called [fonti](download link).

fonti allows you 
* to select a font from the collection of the default font, Courgette Regular, Noto Sans Bold, and Oxygen Mono Regular.

fonti, however, loses the ability to:
* display Android type. Can't set style in code. :worried:

Here is a video of fonti:
